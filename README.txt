# Portfolio Site
  This project was created using Node, Pug and Express.js. The project was
  designed to work on localhost:3000. Images will not load if the user uses
  a different port. The purpose of this site was to showcase all the projects
  I have built. I created an error.pug file that displays the error.message,
  error.status, and error.stack properties. If the user tries to navigate to
  a nonexistent route like error/error, the user will receive a friendly 404
  error displaying a "back" button to go back to projects. Also, a
  message will be logged to the console, letting the developer know that something
  went wrong.
  I used a different font (Poppins) for the site, changed the color and background
  color of a few elements in the document. I also added a border to the box
  displaying the skills and technologies. I added a loop to the images in the
  project pug file to make the application more dynamic
  Fellow developer can start this application with npm start.
